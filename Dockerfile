# YOUR Dockerfile. Generated once by `insights new-app`; yours to edit from here.
#   app:  headcount-dashboard
#   base: python-web
#
# The platform does not rewrite this file and `insights upgrade-scaffold` does not
# touch it - unlike .github/workflows/, which we do own. You can add build stages,
# system packages, whatever your app needs.
#
# FOUR THINGS CI CHECKS, and why (ADR-004):
#
#   1. FROM is a published insights-hub base    we patch these; a base from Docker Hub
#                                               is one nobody is patching for you
#   2. no :latest                               an image you cannot name is one you
#                                               cannot roll back to
#   3. the final USER is not root               a container breakout should land on a
#                                               user that owns nothing
#   4. the base version is current              `insights doctor` warns, CI fails on
#                                               prod deploys. THIS IS THE ONE THAT
#                                               MATTERS: because this file is yours,
#                                               a CVE fix in the base reaches you only
#                                               when you bump the line below. We tell
#                                               you loudly; we cannot do it for you.
